## About Capstone Project

The outcome of the Data Science Capstone Course on Coursera is to create a shiny app that will allow the user to put in a string of words from a file provided by the course and will return the most likely next word in the string.  This is done by creating strings of words that can be searched and can quickly return the most frequently missing word in the string


When the application opens, the default word on the input line is NULL.  The results are posted in the box titled Predicted Next Word.  The results are the output of the prediction model created using bi, tri and quadgrams on the data provided for the course.
